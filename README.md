# jquery-tslot

This is a jQuery plugin for turning a list in a slotmachine wheel. The plugin
should work with jquery 1.4++, but currently is not heavily tested.

The plugin was originally inspired by [Matthew Lein's jSlots](https://github.com/matthewlein/jQuery-jSlots),
but we had to rewrite it, to fit our needs.

As the plugin should also work for jQuery 1.4, we could not use the jquery
widget approach. Therefore the jquery plugin structure is lent from
[Building an Object-Oriented jQuery Plugin](http://www.virgentech.com/blog/2009/10/building-object-oriented-jquery-plugin.html)
to provide a reusable component holding state.
